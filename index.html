        <h1>Peripetual</h1>
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm Tammy, hi!</p>
        <p>I'm a first year college student majoring in Computer Science!</p>
        <p>I'm also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an epic gamer obsessing over indie horror games</li>
            <li>a casual artist specializing in digital art</li>
            <li>a casual athlete doing Calisthenics</li>
            <li>a polyglot self-studying Chinese and Korean</li>
            <li>a bookworm <strong>CONSUMING</strong> knowledge</li>
            <li>and... the creator of this blog!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>I'm always constantly reading and consuming material, which is fun and all, but I want to <em>create</em> something.</p>
        <p>So I created this blog: <strong>Peripetual</strong>!</p>
        <p>In my blog, I will share with everyone what I have learned and found useful from the many books and articles that I read, along with my own insights.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, you'll find my input useful and get something out of this blog!</p>
        <p>Although my content will be predominantly about self-improvement, I will be writing on a variety of other topics such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>psychology</li>
            <li>nutrition</li>
            <li>education</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and more!</p>
